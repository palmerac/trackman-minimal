{{DATA}}

Before analyzing, note how many shots each club has. Treat any club with fewer than 5 shots as low-confidence, and exclude obvious mishits from averages (mention any shots you exclude). If a Tag column is present, break results down by tag within each club.

Please provide a club-by-club breakdown of this session. For each club represented in the data:
- Summarize average carry distance and ball speed
- Note the player's strengths with that club
- Identify weaknesses or areas for improvement

Then provide an overall summary:
- Which clubs are performing the strongest?
- Where are the biggest distance gaps between clubs? Are those gaps appropriate?
- What 1 to 2 adjustments would most improve overall performance?

If any suggested adjustment involves equipment (a different club, shaft, or loft), do not guess my current setup. Ask me short questions about the clubs and shafts I play now, and refine that recommendation after I answer.

Use moderate technical depth. Briefly explain what metrics mean when you reference them.`

Tab-separated Trackman golf session data:

{{DATA}}

If you have a code execution or data analysis tool available, use it for the statistics below; otherwise present them as estimates and say so.

Perform a consistency analysis across all shots and clubs:
- Calculate or estimate standard deviation ranges for key metrics (club speed, ball speed, launch angle, spin rate, carry)
- Identify which clubs show the tightest dispersion and which are most variable
- Analyze shot-to-shot repeatability patterns: is the player consistent in face angle, club path, and dynamic loft?
- Identify any outlier shots (significant deviations from the mean) and note which metrics are responsible
- Provide a consistency rating summary per club and overall

Ground rules:
- Report the shot count per club and treat clubs with fewer than 5 shots as low-confidence
- Exclude obvious mishits from averages and standard deviations, but list them as outliers
- The data header notes the hitting surface; mat strikes can mask fat contact, so factor that into strike-quality judgments
- If a metric referenced above is not present in the data, say so rather than estimating it

Reference specific metric values and numbers throughout. Prioritize data over general advice.`

Here is the tab-separated Trackman golf session data:

{{DATA}}

Analyze the player's launch and spin data:
- Review launch angle and spin rate combinations per club
- Compare them to typical optimal windows for each club type (e.g., driver: ~12-15 deg launch, ~2200-2700 rpm spin). These windows shift with ball speed: faster ball speeds favor lower spin and launch, slower ball speeds need more of both
- Use spin axis to describe curve tendencies. For a right-handed player, a positive spin axis means the ball curves right (fade/slice) and a negative spin axis means it curves left (draw/hook); this is reversed for left-handers
- Identify which clubs are closest to optimal and which are farthest

For clubs that are outside optimal windows:
- Explain what the current numbers mean in terms of ball flight (too high, too low, too much spin, etc.)
- Suggest specific adjustments to move toward optimal conditions

Before recommending any loft or shaft change, interview me briefly: ask whether I am right- or left-handed, what loft and shaft (flex and weight) I currently play in the relevant clubs, and whether this session used range balls or premium balls. Give your preliminary read from the data first, then refine the recommendations after I answer.

{{DATA}}

First: if I have not said whether I am right- or left-handed, ask me, because every direction below flips for left-handers. You may give a preliminary read assuming right-handed, clearly labeled as such.

Analyze the player's shot shape and miss patterns:
- Review face angle, club path, face-to-path, and curve values to characterize their typical shot shape per club. For a right-handed player, positive club path = in-to-out (draw-biased) and positive face angle = open to the target (starts right)
- Identify if they play a consistent shot shape (draw, fade, straight) or if the pattern varies
- Review the Side and CarrySide data to understand lateral dispersion -- how far off-center do shots typically land? State the sign convention you assume for these columns
- Identify their most common miss direction and the likely technical cause (face angle, path, or both)

Provide:
- A shot shape profile for each club (e.g., "mild fade", "variable with occasional hook")
- An overall assessment of dispersion consistency
- 1 to 2 actionable suggestions to tighten their pattern

Exclude obvious mishits from the pattern read (note them separately), and if a metric referenced above is not in the data, say so rather than estimating it.

Assume a right-handed player unless I have said otherwise; state that assumption and ask me to confirm. If you have a code execution or data analysis tool, use it for the statistics below; otherwise keep the analysis qualitative and label any numbers as estimates.

Analyze club delivery metrics across all clubs and shots. Focus on:

- Club Path (in/out vs out/in) and how it correlates to curve and spin axis
- Face Angle at impact and the face-to-path relationship as the primary driver of curvature
- Dynamic Loft per club compared to expected values. If your conclusions depend on my actual club lofts, ask me for them rather than assuming stock lofts
- Which delivery metrics most strongly relate to carry distance, spin rate, and side error for this player

For each major club category (driver, irons, wedges):
- Report average delivery numbers along with the shot count behind them
- Identify the most impactful delivery variable affecting performance
- Flag any delivery patterns that suggest mechanical inefficiency
